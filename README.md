# Hacking With Swift Classic : Challenge Day 59 : CountriesInfos

Project with two UITableViewController and a json file which was created to store all infos of countries that we find then on the two tableView.

"Your challenge is to make an app that contains facts about countries: show a list of country names in a table view,
then when one is tapped bring in a new screen that contains its capital city, size, population, currency, and any other facts that interest you.
The type of facts you include is down to you – Wikipedia has a huge selection to choose from.

To make this app, I would recommend you blend parts of project 1 project 7.
That means showing the country names in a table view, then showing the detailed information in a second table view.

How you load data into the app is going to be an interesting problem for you to solve.
I suggested project 7 above because a sensible approach would be to create a JSON file with your facts in,
then load that in using contentsOf and parse it using Codable. Regardless of how you end up solving this,
I suggest you don’t just hard-code it into the app – i.e., typing all the facts manually into your Swift code. You’re better than that!"
